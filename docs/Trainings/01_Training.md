# Training

In AgileLab we believe that people's continuous learning and improvement is the only key to success.

For this reason, several [Welfare & Benefits](WelfareAndBenefits.md) are provided in order to incentive as much as possible the personal and professional growth. 

## The circle
AgileLab has a specific `circle:Training` to fulfill the purpose of `never stop growing`. The circle promotes upskilling as individual and collective practice. Upskilling means to improve both hard (e.g. technical) and soft skills (e.g. company values, leadership), and isn't limited to technical roles.
You are encouraged to get to know the circle and its offerings in terms of accountability and roles.

## The portal
AgileLab has a [portal](TrainingPortal.md) that centralizes all resources regarding Training, from tutorials, to coding repositories and the courses. You can check it out at https://agilefactory.gitlab.io/training/training-portal/

## Courses
AgileLab provides internal courses in its Learning Management System (LMS). For further details, please read the [Courses](Courses.md) page.

## Workshops
AgileLab frequently organizes internal tech workshops. For further details, please read the dedicated [section](Workshops.md).

## Language Learning
AgileLab provides the possibility to improve the language skills. For further details, please read the dedicated [Language Learning](LanguageLearning.md) page.

## Other Training material
You can find plenty of other training resources:
- Slides and past training material in `sharepoint://BigData/Documents/Training/`
- books: we have a [Library](Library.md) and a [Book club](BookClub.md)

Along with all these resources, as reported in [Welfare & Benefits](WelfareAndBenefits.md), remember that you also have an important personal annual budget to spend in OTHER training material: make good use of it!

## Time Tracking

All the guidelines to be followed for time tracking on Elapseit are available in [Project Time Tracking](ProjectTimesheet.md) (focus on the Training section).
