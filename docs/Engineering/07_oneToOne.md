# 1:1 

The 1:1 meeting is an important moment because both parties can have a two-way feedback loop. 
Feedback is really important to build trust and in order to do it effectively you have to approach this activity carefully.
Because it is a private meeting this is the right time to provide negative feedback. For many, it is more comfortable to give feedback to, and receive feedback from, those with whom you have already established trust

The first step to build trust is being candid and starting from task based feedback and only in a second step moving towards behavioural feedback. It is easier and confortable to tell someone that there is a typo in something they have written than to tell someone their leadership is ineffective because they micromanage, for example.

To provide effective feedbacks is important to clearly identify a situation or an experience about the bad behaviour, to highlight the impacts of that and more important to be able to suggest an alternative way to do it differently.

Instead when you receive feedbacks is important to actively listen without refusing it and more important assume positive intent about the giver, because it is uncomfortable also for her/him.

1:1 is also an occasion to intercept personal problems and to raise hand about them.

1:1 should also be a moment where you can be an example to others and reinforce self-management concepts, the team leader should ask if the team member has non-project circle activities and state again that the team member can safely dedicate time to those activities without asking permission. Often a new team member not accustomed to the self-management pratice will still not dedicate time to non-project activities with fear of subtracting time to the project, state clearly that this is something that can be resolved only with communication between project leaders/lead link of other circles/team member and offer help in sorting priorities and state clearly if the project can afford the expected reduction of effort from a team member that works also on other circle activities.
