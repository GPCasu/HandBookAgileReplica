# Conferences


As part of the benefits offered to employees, Agile Lab offers the opportunity to attend one international conference per year, leveraging company money following the boundaries listed in [Welfare & Benefits](WelfareAndBenefits.md#training-budget).

The process to attend an international conference is listed below.

# Checklist and accountabilities

Once identified the conference to attend to, an employee must:

1. Get the participation approved by your coach (project lead/lead link);
2. Broadcast the conf opportunity on Teams in the `BigData/conferences` channel: not travelling alone is helpful in getting more involved in conference networking, joining multiple talks in parallel and have more fun;
3. Once approved and verified how many other colleagues will join in the conference trip, ask {% role %}Finance/Purchasing Officer{% endrole %} to buy the conference tickets;
4. Search by your own for travelling and accommodation, according to the rules as in [SpendingCompanyMoney](SpendingCompanyMoney.md#Expenses);
5. Ask {% role %}Finance/Purchasing Officer{% endrole %} to buy you the travel tickets and book for your accommodation. If not possible, do it on your own expenses (they will be reimbursed with the next payroll);
6. Once the tickets are confirmed, add the details of the conference in the conference tracking excel placed under - 
   `sharepoint://BigData/Documents/Conferences/conference_tracking_<Year>.xlsx`
7. Enjoy the conference. In the meantime, take at least 1 meaningful photo per day (picturing Agile Lab's people in the context of the conference and meaningful stuff) and send it to marketing@agilelab.it;
8. Take notes during the attended talks and produce a report of the conference containing meaningful insights that can support/improve company's technical skills, and/or open to new opportunities. The report must be published on the company's *Big Data* OneNote -> *Conferences* section, following the template that will be made available in such section. Once completed, it must be advertised/shared/linked on the `BigData/conferences` Teams channel. Given that multiple people could attend to multiple talks in the same conference, each of the participants has the accountability to produce his/her own report.

NOTE: 
1. During the pandemic, be sure that tickets are refundable in case the conference is canceled.
2. If there are good number of employees attending for a conference, we can reach out to our {% role %}Vendor Relationship Officer (VRO){% endrole %}, if they can help us by contacting the conference organisers for the discounts.

That's it! Pretty simple, right? A small accountability for a big benefit. :)


# Checklist for the coach

Which are the drivers that should be taken in account to evaluate conferences:

* Is the conference aligned with the individual career path, technical progression and personal goals
* Is the conference aligned with the technical strategy of the company ?
* Is the conference aligned with team goals and needs ?
