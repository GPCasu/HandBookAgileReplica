# OffBoarding
If you are reading this, probably is a sad moment because you or someone else is leaving.
Agile Lab does not provide any context around why people are leaving when they do, not for a lack of transparency but to preserve the individual privacy. 


Here you can find a good way to manage this important moment of your career:

1.  Don't communicate it to the team or your friends before to talk with your BU Lead/Project Lead
2.  Ask for a 1-1 meeting with your BU Lead/Project Lead mentioning the fact you want to quit, this will elevate your priority to the maximum level.
3.  Evaluate with attention the counteroffer.
4.  Ask for an Exit Call with the HR: this allows you to provide feedback on your work experience, enabling HR to identify systemic issues and areas for improvement within the organization, as well as to develop strategies to enhance talent retention. Rember to check with HR about your notice period; In case you decide to leave:
  - Communicate your resignation to **INPS** through the dedicated portal, using your credentials (SPID, CNS, or PIN)
  - On the portal, you will be asked to enter the companyâ€™s certified email (PEC), which is pec@agilelab.it, and to specify the effective date of your resignation (decorrenza dimissioni), meaning your first day not working at Agile Lab
  - You can revoke your resignation on the same site within 7 days from the date you submitted it
  - If you have a child under the age of 3, you will need to validate your resignation at the competent ITL (Ispettorato Territoriale del Lavoro)
  - Agree with your manager the **next steps** with the customer: your last day on the project and your last day in the company
5. Decide how and when to communicate it to the team (this is your own responsibility), but after the company eventually communicated it to the customer.
6. Return of company property: contact the Purchasing Officer to arrange the return of HW Monitors, Smartphones and Laptops, and the Facility Manager of your office for keys, access badges, etc.

On your last day in the company:
