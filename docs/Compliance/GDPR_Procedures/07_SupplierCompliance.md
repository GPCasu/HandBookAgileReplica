## Compliance Check

Without any limitations on additional verification activities that may be necessary for the proper evaluation of relevant profiles regarding GDPR compliance and other privacy requirements imposed on individual Suppliers, the following is an illustrative guide to the main Compliance Audit checks.

The Audit aims to periodically verify:
(i) the implementation of security measures to ensure data integrity, availability, and recovery as guaranteed by the Supplier, and
(ii) compliance with contractual parameters imposed on the Supplier.

Compliance Audits are conducted annually for all suppliers. This activity is managed by the Internal Technical Compliance team with the assistance of the GDPR & Cybersecurity Legal Account.

The Compliance Audit should be sent to Suppliers via PEC (Certified Electronic Mail) or email.

Documents, receipts, and PECs will be stored by the Internal Technical Compliance team in the relevant folder within the Sharepoint Compliance area.
