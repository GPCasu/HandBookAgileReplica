**Data retention**

The data you provide will be stored for the entire duration of the contractual relationship.

Your data may be made accessible for the purposes mentioned above to employees and collaborators of the Data Controller as well as to third-party companies or affiliates of AGILE LAB or other entities (e.g., consultants) that carry out outsourcing activities on behalf of the Data Controller, in their capacity as external data processors.
