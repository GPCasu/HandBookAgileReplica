# Alerting Protocol

In order to communicate any service disruptions or issues related to the company's activities to clients, third parties, or any situation that may become public or used against the company, the Responsible Technical Officer (RTO) appointed at the time should send the communication.

Every event should be recorded in the designated register on SharePoint, and copies of the communications should be saved in the same folder.
