Agilelab has created its own Management System compliant with international standards ISO 9001, SA8000, ISO 27001, ISO 22301 and ISO 27701, which allows it to guarantee internal efficiency, an adequate level of safety and internal worker satisfaction, information security and employee protection. personal data, with a better predisposition to satisfy the needs of customers.

Agilelab has decided to adopt an integrated policy, in order to univocally direct the choice of strategies and consequent activities.

In defining its policy, Agilelab considered:

- Compliance with mandatory requirements, as well as those established independently by the company, as well as international regulations, universally accepted principles and fundamental ILO standards;
- The continuous improvement of its processes, through activities based on verifying their effectiveness, as well as their efficiency and, therefore, their real applicability to the production context;

Agilelab undertakes to maintain a high standard of its services and to guarantee compliance with their requirements.

We believe that the IT sector has an important role to play in finding sustainable solutions for today's climate challenges.

We will engage with stakeholders in the fight against climate change through awareness-raising actions on the topic.

- **Integrity**: the information must be modifiable only and exclusively by those who have the privileges;
- **Availability**: the information must be accessible and usable when requested by processes and users who have the relevant privileges. Availability goals include resilience goals.


This policy defines the principles of information and personal data security that guide the behavior of the subjects to whom it is addressed, within the scope of the SGSI, as well as the implementation of processes, procedures, instructions, the adoption of practices and other controls within the ISMS.

Below are the principles that determine and support the definition and implementation of the SGI to guarantee information security:

5.	All those who come, in various capacities, into contact with the information to be protected have a direct role in the success of said protection. It is, therefore, the direct and explicit responsibility of these subjects to comply with the principles contained in this policy and in all applicable security policies related to it and to guarantee compliance.
